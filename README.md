# RegSNPs-ASB
RegSNPs-ASB is a pipeline for extracting regulatory SNPs from ATAC-seq data. RegSNPs-ASB first call TFBS and heterozygote SNP using published tools. In each TFBS with heterozygote SNP, RegSNPs-ASB will take a generalized linear model to identify allele-specific TF binding events. These functional candidate variants can help us understand the molecular mechanism of complex diseases and provide an essential foundation for experimental follow-up analysis.
